# Review-guidelines 
Pull request review guidelines, checklists, or templates in github can significantly streamline the review process and ensure consistent feedback across your team. Here's how you can set them up:
1. Define review guidelines and objectives - Clarify the objectives of PR reviews. Define what aspect need review (code readability, logic, security, tests, documentation, etc).
2. Develop review checklist or template - Identify key areas : list specific areas or aspects to be reviewed in the code.
Example checklist items :

3. Security vulnerabilities and best practices.
4. Test coverage and cases
